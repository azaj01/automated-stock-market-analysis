##  Architecture Overview
Our system is powered by CrewAI, a multi-agent framework that allows sequential, role-based execution. Each agent is responsible for a specific task in the pipeline, ensuring a modular and interpretable architecture.

 Agents in Action
- Stock Name Agent – Identifies stock ticker symbols
- Company Profile & Currency Agent – Fetches company metadata from Yahoo Finance
- Financial Data Agent – Retrieves structured financial data for the target stock
- News Agent – Scrapes recent headlines and news articles
- Stock Market Analyst Agent – Aggregates expert analyst opinions using SerpAPI
- Sentiment Agent – Applies FinBERT to classify public sentiment from news
- Final Analysis Agent – Synthesizes all inputs to generate a Buy, Sell, or Hold recommendation

Workflow Structure
Crew – The top-level orchestrator that manages agent flow
Tasks – Each agent is assigned a defined role with tool access and output expectations
Sequential Flow – The agents execute one after another, ensuring dependencies are respected

 Built on CrewAI's structured agent collaboration, this system brings together LLMs, APIs, and real-time data to produce intelligent financial insights.

##  Results

###  Comparative Evaluation: AI vs. Analyst Consensus

Our CrewAI-powered LLM system was benchmarked against gold-standard analyst forecasts from TipRanks using three high-profile stocks — NVDA, TSLA, and GME.

---

###  NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)

![NVDA Result](NVDA.png)

-  **AI Justification**: Average target $160.47 → Predicted `BUY`
-  **TipRanks Consensus**: Average target $168.43 → Recommended `BUY`
-  **BERTScore**: `Precision: 0.9126`, `Recall: 0.9485`, `F1: 0.9302`

---

###  TSLA (Tesla, Inc.)

![TSLA Result](TSLA.png)

-  **AI Justification**: Average target $304.38 → Predicted `HOLD`
-  **TipRanks Consensus**: Average target $284.74 → Recommended `HOLD`
-  **BERTScore**: `Precision: 0.7982`, `Recall: 0.8612`, `F1: 0.8285`

---

###  GME (GameStop Corp.)

![GME Result](GME.png)

-  **AI Justification**: Average target $13.50 → Predicted `SELL`
-  **TipRanks Consensus**: Average target $13.50 → Recommended `SELL`
-  **BERTScore**: `Precision: 0.7964`, `Recall: 0.8688`, `F1: 0.8310`

---

###  Conclusion

Our system's final recommendations closely mirror those from trusted platforms like TipRanks.  
With BERTScore F1 values consistently above `0.82`, this validates the reliability, interpretability, and effectiveness of our multi-agent LLM-based financial analysis pipeline.
